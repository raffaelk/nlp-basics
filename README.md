# Basic NLP Projects
This repo is a collection of some small projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They started as part of a semster assignment of the NLP course of Ryan Cotterell at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The code for my original hand-in is in a separate [repo](https://github.com/raffaelk/NLP20_Assignment). Here I present an extended version of the original tasks, with some added features and documentation.
