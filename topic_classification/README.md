# Topic Classification of Newspaper Headlines
In this multiclass classification problem, a set of newspaper headlines is classified into distinct topic categories. 

This project started as part of a semster assignment of the NLP course of Ryan Cotterell at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The code for my original hand-in is in a separate [repo](https://github.com/raffaelk/NLP20_Assignment). Here I present an extended version of the original tasks, with some added features and documentation.

## Main Technologies Used
- Language: Python 
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Analysis and Modelling: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK

## Data Analysis
In the first part of the notebook [topic_classification.ipynb](topic_classification.ipynb) an extended data analysis was performed. With graphical and statistical tools it could be shown how the importance of certain topics and words evolved over time.

## Model
In the second part of the notebook [topic_classification.ipynb](topic_classification.ipynb) a predictive model to automatically classify headlines has been created. An accuracy of approximately 75% was achieved.
