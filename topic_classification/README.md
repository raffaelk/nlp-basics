## Data Analysis
In the first part of the notebook [topic_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/raffaelk/nlp-basics/blob/main/topic_classification.ipynb) an extended data analysis was performed. With graphical and statistical tools it could be shown how the importance of certain topics and words evolved over time.

## Model
In the second part of the notebook [topic_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/raffaelk/nlp-basics/blob/main/topic_classification.ipynb) a predictive model to automatically classify headlines has been created. An accuracy of approximately 75% was achieved.
